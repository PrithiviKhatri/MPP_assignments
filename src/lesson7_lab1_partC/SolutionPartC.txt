Issue was because Employee class has not implemented the hashcode method.
ContainsKey method of hashmap uses hashcode method of an object to assign the postion of key part of hashmap.If the hashcode method of 
an object is not overriden, same object is placed into  the different bucket in hashmap .Thus containsKey cannot find the same Employee
in the same bucket and returns false, thus allowing same employee to be treated as different keys.
Solution to override hashcode in Employee class:

@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		return this.getSalary() ;
	};
