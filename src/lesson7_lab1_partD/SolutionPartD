Issue was with how the hashmap works.If the hashcode of two objects are same , then hashmap uses equals method of object to see 
if they are equal .If they are unequal , the object is put in the same bucket of the hashcode .Thus , a single bucket can have 
more than two objects.

//Part of code
if(!tracker.containsKey(e)) {
			System.out.println(e.getName());	
				tracker.put(e, e);
				noDupsList.add(e);
			} else {
				tracker.get(e).setVisited(true);
			}
			
here else part is changing the default value of Visit from false to true ,which makes two employee objects unequal.And these unequal objects 
are put in the same bucket in the hashmap as they have same  hashcode.Thus, hashmap has duplicate employee object with it,though they differ 
only on the value of Visited.

solution is to remove the else part which sets value of Visited boolean.
