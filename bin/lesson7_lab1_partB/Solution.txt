Issue was with equals method of Employee.
Actually ,Employee was not overriding the Object equal method,since equals method of Employee is taking Employee as an argument 
not Object as argument.Hence ,contains method of list is calling Object's equal method which is always returning false.
Solution :Override the equals methods in Employee.

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		Employee e=(Employee)obj;
		return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary==salary;
	}
